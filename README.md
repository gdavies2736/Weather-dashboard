1. Description

The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard application that allows the user to search for a city and find out about the weather. When the user searches for a city they will see both the current weather for that city and also the 5-day forecast. 
 
When the user is presented with the current weather, they will see the city name, the date, an icon, the temperature, the humidity and the wind speed.

When the user is presented with the 5-day forecast, they will see the date, an icon, the temperature and the humidity.

When a user clicks on one of the previous searches they will see the current weather and 5-day weather forecast.

This application uses Open Weather API.

Here is a screenshot showing how the user has searched for the city Dublin and has been presented with the current weather and also a 5-day forecast.
